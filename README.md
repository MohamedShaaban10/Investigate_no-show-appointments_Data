# Investigate_no-show-appointments_Data
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

What do I need to install? You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:(pandas,NumPy,Matplotlib, and seaborn) It will be recommend to installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook.

Why this Project? In this project, we have to go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. I have also use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier!

What I have learn? After completing the project, I have learned following : Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use Have practice communicating the results of your analysis Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
